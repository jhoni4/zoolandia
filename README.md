Zoolandia - Method Overloading

Setup

cd ~/workspace/zoolandia
git checkout -b version-3
Instructions

Add a new, overloaded constructor method to your animal that takes a single string as an argument.
Inside the new constructor, using this, assign the value of the name property with the argument value.
Create an instance of your animal like before, but pass in the name of the animal as an argument.

Squirrel superman = new Squirrel("Sammy");
Console.Write(superman.name);
Add another overloaded constructor method that will set the value of one of the int typed properties of your animal. Define an integer as an argument and then create another instance of your animal and pass it an integer.

Add ONE MORE constructor method! This method will accept both an integer and a string as arguments. Set the appropriate property values with the argument values.
